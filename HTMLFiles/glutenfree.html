            <p class= "wildseedCaption">California chain Asian Box has been honored as one of the city’s worst-named restaurants, but it’s a go-to for those who eschew gluten, as it’s completely free of the ingredient. It's also good for the picky, as each box can be customized to order. With proteins like pork, chicken, and shrimp as well as a panoply of greens, the potential combinations are endless.</p>

            <p class= "wildseedCaption">Even the gluten challenged deserve a soft, pillowy bun. Lots of burger spots around town offer to swap in lettuce leaves, but Roam respects the craving: Every burger on the menu is available on a gluten-free bun, and the veggie burgers are gluten-free, too.</p>

            <p class= "wildseedCaption">Presidio Heights' all-day cafe As Quoted is all about gluten-free everything, including the toast, topped with banana or avocado, which is made daily with sorghum and multigrain flours, honey, eggs, and avocado oil. For bigger portions, get the chicken bone broth.</p>

            <p class= "wildseedCaption">It's pretty much impossible to find an Italian restaurant that serves amazing gluten-free pasta, but Bella Trattoria, a charming and authentic restaurant in the Inner Richmond, is doing just that. Though Bella makes its pasta in house, it does buy its gluten-free quinoa alternative. However, it's the sauces, like arrabbiata, puttanesca, and salsiccia, that are the real hero of the dishes, so one truly doesn't mind. If you really need an Italian dish that's made in house though, there are also a couple of gluten-free gnocchi dishes that also knock it out of the park.</p>

            <p class= "wildseedCaption">Chef Gonzalo Guzman’s beloved Mexican restaurant features corn masa and tortillas, soaked, shaped, and slapped by hand. That makes it easier to dodge wheat, from the butter bean tamales to blue corn quesadillas to tangy-sweet carnitas.</p>
